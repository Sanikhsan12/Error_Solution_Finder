when after installing flutter. we try to run it in VS code or Android Studio.
Most of the time we get this error as stated above. there are two or more
solutions to this. I am will discuss three possible solutions to this.
Git is not installed.
if you cant see git in your installed applications. then the best way to install
git with minimum effort is with the help of chocolatey. Here is the reference
how to install chocolatey on your system.
After its installed simply write this command “choco install git.install” in
your administrator shell. it will automatically install latest git for you and
will automatically set the PATH in windows environment variables.

Git is installed but there is still an error.
then firstly you should check your path in environment variables. these
three should be there
C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe;C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;C:\Windows\System32
pasting these in environment variables will hopefully solve the problem or
else find your path in your installed directory.
Permissions problems.
If every thing is set the final step could be to change the permissions for
your IDE. for that right click your IDE application go to properties go to
compatibility. and then check the option. “Run this program  as an
adm inistrator”
properties menu.
This will solve the problem for you. Thanks
