JavaScript - Errors & Exceptions Handling
Error handling in Ja vaScript is a process to detect and handle errors that occurs during the
execution of a progr am. Errors can be a syntax, runtime or logical errors. An error occurred during
the ex ecution of the progr am is called a runtime error or an ex ception.
In JavaScript, errors can occur due to progr amming mistak es, incorrect user input, etc. Errors can
disrupt code ex ecution and lead to bad user experience. Effectiv e error & ex ception handling is
required for building robust, reliable and user friendly applications in Ja vaScript.
What is an Error?
An error is an ev ent that occurs during the ex ecution of a progr am that prev ents it from continuing
normally . Errors can be caused b y a variety of factors, such as syntax  errors, runtime  errors, and
logical  errors.
Syntax Errors
Syntax errors, also called parsing errors , occur at compile time in tr aditional progr amming
languages and at interpret time in Ja vaScript.
For example, the following line causes a syntax error because it is missing a closing parenthesis.
<script>
   window.print();
</script>
When a syntax error occurs in Ja vaScript, only the code contained within the same thread as the
syntax error is affected, and the rest of the code in other threads gets ex ecuted, assuming nothing
in them depends on the code containing the error .
Runtime Errors (Ex ceptions)
Runtime errors, also called exceptions , occur during ex ecution (after compilation/interpretation). Home  Whiteboard  Graphing Calculator  Online Compilers  Practice  Articles  T

For example, the following line causes a runtime error because the syntax is correct here, but at
runtime, it is trying to call a method that does not exist.
<script>
   window.printme();
</script>
Exceptions also affect the thread in which they occur , allowing other Ja vaScript threads to continue
normal ex ecution.
There are man y JavaScript runtime errors (ex ceptions), some are as follows −
Logical Errors
Logic errors can be the most difficult t ype of errors to tr ack down. These errors are not the result
of a syntax or runtime error . Instead, they occur when y ou mak e a mistak e in the logic that driv es
your script and do not get the expected result.
For example, when y ou divide an y numeric v alue with 10, it returns undefined.
<script>
   let num = 10/0;
</script>ReferenceError  − Trying to access an undefined v ariable/ method.
TypeError  − Attempting an oper ation on incompatible data t ypes.
RangeError  − A v alue ex ceeds the allowed r ange.

What is Error Handling?
Whenev er any error occurs in the Ja vaScript code, the Ja vaScript engine stops the ex ecution of the
whole code. If y ou handle such errors in the proper w ay, you can skip the code with errors and
continue to ex ecute the other Ja vaScript code.
You can use the following mechanisms to handle the error .
The try...catch...ﬁnally Statement
The latest v ersions of Ja vaScript added ex ception handling capabilities. Ja vaScript implements the
try...catch...finally construct as well as the throw oper ator to handle ex ceptions.
You can catch progr ammer -gener ated and runtime ex ceptions, but y ou cannot catch Ja vaScript
syntax errors.
Here is the try ...catch...finally block syntax −
<script>
   try {
      // Code to run
      [break;]
   } 
   catch ( e ) {
      // Code to run if an exception occurs
      [break;]
   }
   [ finally {
      // Code that is always executed regardless of 
      // an exception occurring
   }]
</script>
The try block must be followed b y either exactly one catch block or one finally block (or one of
both). When an ex ception occurs in the try block, the ex ception is placed in e and the catch block
is executed. The optional finally block ex ecutes unconditionally after try/catch.try...catch...finally statements

Example
Here is an example where we are trying to call a non-existing function which in turn is r aising an
exception.
Let us try to catch this ex ception using try ...catch and displa y a user -friendly message. Y ou can
also suppress this message, if y ou want to hide this error from a user .
You can use finally block which will alw ays ex ecute unconditionally after the try/catch.
<html>
<head>
<script>               
   try {
      var a = 100;
      alert(myFunc(a));                  
   }
   catch (e) {
      alert(e);
   }
   finally {
      alert("Finally block will always execute!"  );
   }
</script>
</head>
<body>
   <p>Exception handling using try...catch...finally statements </p>
</body>
</html>
Output
Exception handling using try...catch...finaly statements
The throw Statement
You can use throw statement to r aise y our built -in ex ceptions or y our customiz ed ex ceptions. Later
these ex ceptions can be captured and y ou can tak e an appropriate action.
Example
Page 5 of 10
The following example demonstr ates how to use a throw statement.
<html>
<head>
<script>
   function  myFunc() {
      var a = 100;
      var b = 0;
      try {
         if ( b == 0 ) {
            throw( "Divide by zero error."  ); 
         } else {
            var c = a / b;
         }
      }
      catch ( e ) {
         alert("Error: "  + e );
      }
   }
</script>      
</head>
<body>
   <p>Click the following to see the result :</p>
   <form>
      <input type = "button"  value = "Click Me"  onclick = "myFunc();"  />
   </form>
</body>
</html>
Output
Click the following to see the result:
Click Me
You can r aise an ex ception in one function using a string, integer , Boolean, or an object and then
you can capture that ex ception either in the same function as we did abo ve, or in another function
using a try ...catch block.

The onerror Event Handler Property
The onerror ev ent handler w as the first feature to facilitate error handling in Ja vaScript. The
onerror is an ev ent handler propert y of the 'window' object, which automatically triggers when an y
error occurs on an y element of the web page. Y ou can call the callback function when an y error
occurs to handle the error .
You can follow the syntax below to use the onerror ev ent handler propert y.
window.onerror = errorhandler_func ;
OR
<ele onerror ="errorhandler_func()" > </ele>
In the abo ve syntax, errorhandler_func() will be ex ecuted when an y error will occur .
The onerror  event handler pro vides three pieces of information to identif y the exact nature of the
error −
Example
In the code below , we added the onclick ev ent on the <input> element, and we called the
myFunc() function when users click the input element. The m yFunc() function is not defined. So , it
will throw an error .
We used the 'onerror' ev ent handler to catch the error . In the callback function, we print the error
message, file URL, and line number in the file where the error occurs.
<html>
<body>
   <p> Click the following button to see the result :</p>
   <form>
      <input type = "button"  value = "Click Me"  onclick = "myFunc();"  />
   </form>
   <div id = "demo"> </div>
   <script>
      const output = document .getElementById ("demo");
      window.onerror = function  (msg, url, line) {Error message  − The same message that the browser would displa y for the giv en error
URL − The file in which the error occurred
Line number  − The line number in the giv en URL that caused the error
Page 7 of 10
         output.innerHTML = "Error: "  + msg + "<br>";
         output.innerHTML += "URL: " + url + "<br>";
         output.innerHTML += "Line: "  + line + "<br>";
      }
   </script>
</body>
</html>
Output
Click the following button to see the result:
Click Me
Error: Uncaught ReferenceError: myFunc is not defined
URL: file:///C:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/intex.html
Line: 5
You can use an onerror method, as shown below , to displa y an error message in case there is an y
problem in loading an image.
<img src="myimage.gif"  onerror ="alert('An error occurred loading the image.')"  />
You can use onerror with man y HTML tags to displa y appropriate messages in case of errors.
The Ja vaScript Error Class and Error Object
Whenev er any error occurs in the code, Ja vaScript throws an instance (object) of the error class.
The error object contains the information about the error .
Howev er, Error() is a generic constructor for all t ypes of errors, but different objects exist for
different t ypes of errors.
JavaScript Custom Errors
You can also throw an error with the custom message using the Error() constructor .
const customError = new Error(message);
customError .name = "CustomError" ;
Here, we ha ve created the 'Error' class instance and passed the 'message' as an argument. Also ,
we ha ve changed the v alue of the 'name' propert y. Similarly , you can change the v alue of the
'message' propert y if you don't w ant to pass it as an Error() constructor argument.

JavaScript Error Object Reference
JavaScript Error T ypes or Constructor
JavaScript contains the below t ypes of errors. Y ou can also use it as a constructor to create a new
error of the specific t ype.
Error
Type/ObjectDescription
ErrorIt is a generic constructor for the error . You can also create custom errors
by extending the Error object.
SyntaxErrorThe instance of the S yntaxError is thrown when an y error is in the syntax.
For example, missing parenthesis, in valid JSON, etc.
ReferenceErrorThe reference error occurs when y ou try to access v ariables not defined in
the current scope.
TypeErrorWhen the t ypes of the v ariables is not v alid, Ja vaScript throws the t ype
error.
RangeError When numeric input is out of r ange, it throws the r ange error .
URIErrorJavaScript throws the URIError when y ou pass in valid arguments to the
decodeURI or encodeURI methods.
EvalError Deprecated.
AggregateErrorIt is used to aggregate multiple error objects into a single error object, and
it allows y ou to handle multiple error objects.
Error Object Properties
The Error object contains the two properties.
Property Description
name It is used to set or get an error name.
message It is used to set or get an error message.
Non-Standard Properties and Methods
Here is the list of the non-standard properties and methods of the Error object. Howev er, they are
not supported b y all browsers. So , you should a void using them.
