Array Index Out Of Bounds Exception in Java
Last Updated : 26 Jul, 2025
In Java, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a Runtime Exception thrown only at runtime. The Java Compiler
does not check for this error during the compilation of a program. It occurs when we try to access the element
out of the index we are allowed to, i.e. index >= size of the array.
Java supports the creation and manipulation of arrays as a data structure. The index of an array is an integer
value that has a value in the interval [0, n-1], where n is the size of the array. If a request for a negative or an
index greater than or equal to the size of the array is made, then Java throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
Exception. This is unlike C/C++, where no index of the bound check is done.
Example 1: Here, we are trying to access the index which is greater than or equal to the array length.
Runtime Error Throws an Exception:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 5 out of bounds for length
5
at GFG.main(GFG.java:11)
Here if you carefully see, the array is of size 5. Therefore while accessing its element using for loop, the
maximum index value can be 4, but in our program, it is going till 5 and thus the exception.
Example 2: Here, we are trying to access the index of array which is negative.// Java program to show ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
// when the index is greater than or equal to array length
public class G F G {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // taking array of integers
        int a[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        for (int i = 0; i <= a.length; i++)
            System.out.println(a[i]);
    }
}
// Java program to show ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
// when we access the negative index of array
public class G F G {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // taking array of integers
        int a[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
        // accessing the negative index of array
        System.out.println(a[-2]);Java Tutorial Advanced Java Interview Questions Exercises Examples Quizzes Projects Cheatsheet DSA in Java Java Collection

Handling ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
To handle ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, make sure that index of array is within the valid range. You can
also use the enhanced for-loop to automatically handle this exception.
Example 1: Here, we are checking whether the index is valid or not by taking array length with in the index
range i.e. [0, n-1]

Example 2: Here, we are using enhanced for loop that automatically handles the accessing of array's index    }
}
// Java program to handle ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
// by taking array index within valid range
public class G F G {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // taking array of integers
        int a[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        // here, we have remove equal to sign
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++)
            System.out.println(a[i]);
    }
}
// Java program to handle ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
// by using enhanced for loop
public class G F G {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // taking array of integers
        int a[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        // using enhanced for loop
        for (int e : a) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }

Example 3: Consider enclosing your code inside a try-catch statement and manipulate the exception
accordingly. As mentioned, Java won’t let you access an invalid index and will definitely throw
an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. However, we should be careful inside the block of the catch statement
because if we don’t handle the exception appropriately, we may conceal it and thus, create a bug in your
application.
Output
1 2 3 4 5 
Exception Caught
Here in the above example, you can see that till index 4 (value 5), the loop printed all the values, but as soon
as we tried to access the a[5], the program threw an exception which is caught by the catch block, and it
printed the "Exception Caught" statement.
