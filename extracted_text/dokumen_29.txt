NullPointerException is the most frequently thrown exception in Java applications, accounting for
countless crashes.
It occurs when your code tries to use a variable that doesn't point to any object and instead
refers to nothing (null).
Think of it like trying to open a door that doesn't exist. You reach for the handle, but there's
nothing there—just empty space. Your program does the same thing when it tries to access
methods or properties of a null object, and it crashes as a result.
The good news? NullPointerExceptions are highly preventable once you know what to look for.Ask AI

What Causes NullPointerException
Some of the most common scenarios for a NullPointerException are:
Calling methods on a null object
Accessing a null object’s properties
Accessing an index element (like in an array) of a null object
Passing null parameters to a method
Incorrect conﬁguration for dependency injection frameworks like Spring
Using synchronized on a null object
Throwing null from a method that throws an exception
NullPointerException Example
Here is an example of a NullPointerException thrown when the length() method of a null
String object is called:
public class NullPointerExceptionExample {
    private static void printLength(String str) {
        System.out.println(str.length()); //This will crash! str is null
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        String myString = null;
        printLength(myString);
    }
}
In this example, the length() method of a String object is called without performing a null
check. Since the value of the string passed from the main() method is null, running the above
code causes a NullPointerException:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
    at NullPointerExceptionExample.printLength(NullPointerExceptionExample.
    at NullPointerExceptionExample.main(NullPointerExceptionExample.java:8)
How to Avoid NullPointerException
The NullPointerException can be avoided using checks and preventive techniques like the
following:
Check for null before using an object. You should verify whether an object is null or not
before referencing its methods or properties. For example:
    if (myObject != null) {
    System.out.println(myObject.toString()); //Using object if not null
    } else {
    System.out.println("Object is null");
    }
Using Apache Commons StringUtils for String operations. For example, using
StringUtils.isNotEmpty() for verifying if a string is not null or empty before using it further.
Using primitives rather than objects where possible. For example, int instead of
Integer and boolean instead of Boolean. In Java, primitives cannot have null values.
Writing methods that return empty objects rather than null where possible. For example,
returning empty collections and empty strings from a method.
Fixing the Exam ple
To ﬁx the NullPointerException in the earlier example, the String object should be checked for
null or empty values before it is used any further:
import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;
public class NullPointerExceptionExample {
    private static void printLength(String str) {
        if (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(str)) { //Check to ensure not null or em
            System.out.println(str.length());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Empty string");
        }
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        String myString = null;

    }
}
The code here is updated with a check in the printLength() method that ensures the string is
not null or empty using the apache commons StringUtils.isNotEmpty() method. This check
avoids the NullPointerException since the length() method of the string is called only if it is
not null or empty. Otherwise, the message Empty string is printed to the console.
Why Prevention Matters
NullPointerExceptions are among the most common runtime errors in production Java
applications. A single uncaught NPE can crash user sessions and create poor user experiences.
The prevention techniques above, especially defensive null checking, can eliminate the majority
of these issues before they reach production. But when exceptions do slip through, having the
right monitoring tool makes all the difference.
