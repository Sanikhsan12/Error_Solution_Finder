C++ Exception Handling
An exception is an unexpected event that occurs during program execution. For
example,
double divide_by_zero = 7 / 0;
The above code causes an exception as it is not possible to divide a number by 0.
The process of handling these types of errors in C++ is known as exception
handling.
In C++, we handle exceptions with the help of the try and catch  blocks, along
with the throw  keyword.
try - code that may raise an exception
throw  - throws an exception when an error is detected
catch  - code that handles the exception thrown by the throw  keyword
Note: The throw  statement is not compulsory, especially if we use
standard C++ exceptions.
Syntax for Exception Handling in C++

try {
    // code that may raise an exception
    throw argument;
}
catch (exception) {
    // code to handle exception
} 
Here, we have placed the code that might generate an exception inside the try
block. Every try block is followed by the catch  block.
When an exception occurs, the throw  statement throws an exception, which is
caught by the catch  block.
The catch  block cannot be used without the try block.Thank you for printing our content at www.domain-name.com. Please check back soon for new

The above program divides two numbers and displays the result. But an
exception occurs if the denominator is 0.
To handle the exception, we have put the code
divide = numerator / denominator;  inside the try block. Now, when an exception
occurs, the rest of the code inside the try block is skipped.
The catch  block catches the thrown exception and executes the statements
inside it.
If none of the statements in the try block generates an exception, the catch
block is skipped.
Working of try, throw, and catch statements in C++
Notice that we have thrown the int literal 0 with the code throw 0; .
We can throw any literal or variable or class, depending on the situation and
depending on what we want to execute inside the catch  block.
The catch  parameter int num_exception  takes the value passed by the throw
statement i.e. the literal 0.Thank you for printing our content at www.domain-name.com. Please check back soon for new

Catching All Types of Exceptions
In exception handling, it is important that we know the types of exceptions that
can occur due to the code in our try statement.
This is so that we can use the appropriate catch  parameters. Otherwise, the
try...catch  statements might not work properly.
If we do not know the types of exceptions that can occur in our try block, then
we can use the ellipsis symbol ... as our catch  parameter.
try {
    // code
}
catch (...) {
    // code
} 
C++ Multiple catch Statements
In C++, we can use multiple catch  statements for different kinds of exceptions
that can result from a single block of code.Thank you for printing our content at www.domain-name.com. Please check back soon for new

try {
    // code
} 
catch (exception1) {
    // code
} 
catch (exception2) {
    // code
} 
catch (...) {
    // code
}
Here, our program catches exception1  if that exception occurs. If not, it will
catch exception2  if it occurs.
If there is an error that is neither exception1  nor exception2 , then the code inside
of catch (...) {}  is executed.
Notes:
catch (...) {}  should always be the final block in our try...catch
statement. This is because this block catches all possible exceptions
and acts as the default catch  block.
It is not compulsory to include the default catch  block in our code.
Example 2: C++ Multiple catch Statements
This program divides two numbers and stores the result in an array element.
There are two possible exceptions that can occur in this program:
If the array is out of bounds i.e. if the index of the array is greater than the size
of the array
If a number is divided by 0
These exceptions are caught in multiple catch  statements.Thank you for printing our content at www.domain-name.com. Please check back soon for new

Run Code(/cpp-programming/online-compiler)
Output 1
Enter array index: 5
Error: Array out of bounds!
Here, the array arr only has 4 elements. So, index  cannot be greater than 3.
In this case, index  is 5. So we throw a string literal "Error: Array out of bounds!"
. This exception is caught by the first catch  block.
Notice the catch  parameter const char* msg . This indicates that the catch
statement takes a string  literal as an argument.
Output 2#include <iostream>
using namespace  std;
int main() {
    
    double numerator, denominator, arr[ 4] = { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0};

Enter array index: 2
Enter numerator: 5
Enter denominator: 0
Error: Cannot divide by 0
Here, the denominator is 0. So we throw the int literal 0. This exception is
caught by the second catch  block.
If any other exception occurs, it is caught by the default catch  block.
Output 3
Enter array index: 2
Enter numerator: 5
Enter denominator: 2
2.5
Here, the program runs without any problem as no exception occurs.
C++ Standard Exception
C++ has provided us with a number of standard exceptions that we can use in our
exception handling. Some of them are shown in the table below.
Exception Description
std::exception The parent class of all C++ exceptions.
std::bad_alloc Thrown when a dynamic memory allocation fails.
std::bad_castThrown by C++ when an attempt is made to perform a 
dynamic_cast  to an invalid type.
std::bad_exceptionTypically thrown when an exception is thrown and it 
cannot be rethrown.
There are many other standard exceptions in C++.
These exceptions are defined in the exception  header file.Thank you for printing our content at www.domain-name.com. Please check back soon for new
