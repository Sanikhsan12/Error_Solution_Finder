In this article, we will learn how to handle a java.lang.ArithmeticException in Java.
Syntax:
try {
    // Code that may throw an ArithmeticException
Example: division by zero, 
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Exception handling code
    // Handle the ArithmeticException here
This block is executed when an ArithmeticException is caught
Example: displaying an error message.
    
} finally {
    // Optional block
}
Program to Handle a java.lang.ArithmeticException in Java
Let us understand programmatically, to handle a java.lang.ArithmeticException.
// Java program to handle a java.lang.ArithmeticException
public class GfGArithmeticException 
{
    // main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int dividend = 10;
        int divisor = 0;
        try {
            // attempting division by zero
            int result = dividend / divisor;  
            // print the result
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
