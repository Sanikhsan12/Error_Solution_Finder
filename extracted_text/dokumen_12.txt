Diagnosing	and	Fixing	Gr adle	&	Flutt er	Build	Err ors	—	A
Practical,	St ep-by-Step	Guide
O v e rv i e w
You provided a set of Gradle/Flutter build errors and traces. They repeatedly point to a small set of
root causes that interact with each other:
Gradle / plugin dependency resolution failures where certain artifacts (com.github.Ysj001.Byte
codeUtil:plugin , com.github.Ysj001:DoKitPluginCompat ) could not be resolved because the
artifact variants declare a Java	version not compatible with the build JVM. The logs show:
c omponent	dec lar e s	a	c omponent	c ompatible	with	Ja v a	17	but	the	c onsumer	needed	Ja v a	11 .
Flutter module include and local package resolution failures: include_flutter.groovy  missing,
project(':flutter')  not found, and fiat_module  local path dependency missing in the Flutter
module. Those block flutter pub get /AAR generation and therefore break  Android side
inclusion.
Kotlin / Java JVM target mismatch warnings and resulting Kotlin compilation failures inside the
Flutter tool plugin source (FlutterPlugin.kt ) — unresolved references such as filePermissio
ns, user , read , write . The errors show compileJava (11)  vs compileKotlin (1.8)
inconsistency.
Other incidental issues such as DataBinding BR imports failing and @Deprecated  annotation
warnings.
This guide walks through the logs, extracts the exact error messages, and shows the exact, practical
steps and configuration snippets that will resolve the issues — in the order that matters. Follow the
steps exactly and run the commands shown to verify each step before proceeding to the next.Search for

Your build fails because plugin artifacts and plugin code expect a newer Java/Kotlin toolchain (the
artifacts are compiled for Java 17 and Kotlin expectations differ), while your Gradle or module
settings still target older JVM compatibility (Java 11 or Kotlin jvmTarget 1.8); additionally, local Flutter
module packaging and local path dependencies are missing, preventing generation of .android/incl
ude_flutter.groovy  and causing project(':flutter')  not to be available.

(These points are strictly derived from the logs and prior suggestions included in your interaction;
they are not extra facts.)
If an artifact declares it was built for Java 17 but Gradle/consumer runs on Java 11, resolution
will fail. The logs explicitly state this mismatch.
If a Flutter module depends on a local path package (like fiat_module ) and that folder does not
exist, flutter pub get  fails. Without a successful pub get  and flutter build , .android/inc
lude_flutter.groovy  will not be produced; settings.gradle  that references that file will
therefore fail.

Kotlin and Java compile targets must be consistent. The logs show compileJava  and compileKot
lin  targets differ (11 vs 1.8), and the Kotlin compile step fails within Flutter plugin Kotlin
sources because the JVM target is too low to expose certain APIs referenced there.

Step	0	—	captur e	verification	outputs	(do	this	onc e,	copy	results	her e	if	you
need	further	help)
Run these in the project root and capture outputs:
These two outputs show what Java and what JVM are currently being used. If ./gradlew -version
shows a JVM that is not Java 17 and your plugin artifacts require Java 17, you need to make Gradle
use Java 17.
Step	1	—	Mak e	Gradle	use	Ja va	17	(root	cause	for	man y	dependency
resolution	failur es)
Why	first: The plugin artifact variants in your logs declare compatibility with Java 17; the consumer
(your build) currently needs Java 11. Make the build use Java 17 so dependency resolution and
Kotlin compile can proceed.
What	to	do	(persistent	setting): Edit the project-level gradle.properties  file (create one at the
root if it does not exist) and add:
1# point to your local JDK 17 installation; replace with your actual path
2org.gradle.java.home =C:/jdk17
3org.gradle.jvmargs =-Xmx4096m -Dfile. encoding =UTF-8
What	to	do	(temporary,	Windows	CMD):
1set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk17
2set PATH=%JAVA_HOME% \bin;%PATH%
3gradlew.bat clean build --refresh-dependencies
Verify: ./gradlew -version  should show a JVM location that matches the JDK 17 path you set. If the
artifact resolution error (No matching variant ... Java 17 ) disappears, step 1 succeeded.
Step	2	—	Align	K otlin	jvmTarget 	and	Java	compile	tar get	(fix	c ompileJa va	vs

Why: The logs show compileJava (11)  vs compileKotlin (1.8)  mismatch. This discrepancy
causes Kotlin to target an older JVM where certain APIs (like file permission APIs referenced in FlutManage Consent

terPlugin.kt ) are not available, producing Unresolved reference  errors.
What	to	add	(module-level	or	centralized	inside	subprojects{} ):
Place this in your root build.gradle  inside a subprojects  block, or place equivalent lines in each
module that compiles Kotlin:
1subprojects  {
2    afterEvaluate { project ->
3        if (project.plugins.hasPlugin( 'kotlin' ) || project.plugins.hasPlugin( 'com.android.library' ) 
|| project.plugins.hasPlugin( 'com.android.application' )) {
4            // Kotlin toolchain to 17
5            
project.extensions.findByType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.KotlinJvmProjectExtension)?.jvmToolcha
{
6                languageVersion. set(org.gradle.jvm.toolchain.JavaLanguageVersion.of( 17))
7            }
8            // Kotlin compile tasks set to jvmTarget 17
9            project.tasks.withType(org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile).configureEach {
10                kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = "17"
11            }
12            // Java compile options align with Java 17
13            project.extensions.findByName( "android" )?.with {
14                compileOptions {
15                    sourceCompatibility  JavaVersion.VERSION_17
16                    targetCompatibility  JavaVersion.VERSION_17

18            }

Verify: Re-run ./gradlew clean build . The Inconsistent JVM-target  warning should no longer
appear and the Kotlin compilation of Flutter plugin sources should proceed without Unresolved ref
erence  for filePermissions , user , read , write .
Step	3	—	Ensur e	the	 	 Andr oid	Gradle	Plugin	(A GP)	and	K otlin	Gradle
plugin	ar e	available	in	r oot	build.gradle
Why: The Plugin [id: 'com.android.library'] was not found  message indicates that the
buildscript classpath did not include AGP. Add AGP and Kotlin plugin classpath entries at the root.
Add	/	verify	in	build.gradle 	(root):
1buildscript  {
2    ext.kotlin_version = '1.8.20'
3    repositories  {
4        google()
5        mavenCentral()
6    }
7    dependencies  {
8        classpath  "com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.1.2"
9        classpath  "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
10    }
11}
12 
13allprojects  {
14    repositories  {
15        google()
16        mavenCentral()
17    }
18}
Notes	from	your	logs: You referenced ext.kotlin_version = '1.9.0'  and gradle 7.5  earlier.
The practical set used in the logs and in the assistance was to use kotlin_version = '1.8.20'  with
AGP 8.1.2  — that combination is the one included above in configuration examples from the
conversation.
Verify: Gradle sync should stop reporting com.android.library  missing.
Step	4	—	Fix	Flutt er	module	local	dependency	err ors	and	gener ate
.android/include_flutter.groovy
Why: The include_flutter.groovy  file is missing and pub get  failed because fiat_module  path
dependency does not exist. Without the generated include script, settings.gradle  cannot evaluate
the Flutter module include.
Action	plan	(exact	commands	and	checks):
1. Open coinbyte_flutter_entry/pubspec.yaml  and find the fiat_module  entry:

1dependencies :
2  fiat_module :
3    path: ../fiat_module
2. Ensure the folder ../fiat_module  exists relative to coinbyte_flutter_entry . Based on the
logs, this path was missing and caused flutter pub get  to fail.
3. If fiat_module  is missing, either:
restore or copy fiat_module  into the expected relative path; or
temporarily comment out the fiat_module  dependency in pubspec.yaml  (noting that code
using it will then be broken until you restore it).
4. Run (from coinbyte_flutter_entry ):
1flutter pub get
2flutter build aar    # or `flutter build apk` depending on your integration usage
Outcome	expected	by	the	logs: After flutter build aar , .android/include_flutter.groovy  will
exist at D:\coinbyte_flutter_entry\.android\include_flutter.groovy . That file is referenced by
settings.gradle ; once it exists, the settings evaluation error disappears.
Step	5	—	C orrect	settings.gradle 	include	paths	and	fix	typos
Why: Your logs show path typos such as coinbyte_app-maste  missing an r. Even small path typos
cause FileNotFoundException  for include files. Fix the paths and ensure references are relative to
project root correctly.
Example	fixes	(apply	exactly	in	settings.gradle ):
If you want to apply the generated include script:
apply from:'coinbyte_flutter_entry/.android/include_flutter.groovy'
Or, if you prefer to include the Flutter module as a project directly:
1include ':flutter'
2project( ':flutter' ).projectDir = new File(rootDir, 'coinbyte_flutter_entry/.android/Flutter' )
Verify: ./gradlew projects  or ./gradlew tasks  should no longer fail at settings evaluation. The
error Project with path ':flutter' could not be found  should go away because :flutter  will
be included.
Step	6	—	R un	a	clean	build	and	w atch	for	the	first	r emaining	err or
Commands	(from	project	root):
1flutter clean
2flutter pub get
3./gradlew clean --no-daemon
4./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies --no-daemon
Why: This clears caches and forces dependency resolution again. If the earlier steps were applied
correctly, the build should pass beyond the earlier dependency resolution and Kotlin compile errors.
If any new or remaining error appears, capture it exactly and use it as the next diagnostic input.Manage Consent

Use one of the two approaches:
Include the generated include script (if it exists):
apply from:'coinbyte_flutter_entry/.android/include_flutter.groovy'
Or include Flutter project explicitly (adjust the path if your Flutter module generated a .android/
Flutter  subproject):
1include ':flutter'
2project( ':flutter' ).projectDir = new File(rootDir, 'coinbyte_flutter_entry/.android/Flutter' )Manage Consent

1. Confirm Java and Gradle JVM:
java -version
./gradlew -version
2. If Gradle JVM is not JDK 17, set org.gradle.java.home  in gradle.properties  to your JDK 17
path.
3. Add AGP and Kotlin plugin classpath entries (root build.gradle ).
4. Align Java and Kotlin targets (set sourceCompatibility , targetCompatibility , and kotlinOpti
ons.jvmTarget  to 17; set kotlin.jvmToolchain  to Java 17).
5. Fix missing local Flutter packages (fiat_module ) referenced in coinbyte_flutter_entry/pubspe
c.yaml .
6. Run flutter pub get  in coinbyte_flutter_entry .
7. Run flutter build aar  (or flutter build apk ) to generate .android/include_flutter.groo
vy.
8. Correct settings.gradle  include paths to the generated include or include the :flutter
project explicitly.
9. Clean and rebuild:
flutter clean
flutter pub get
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies
10. If any error remains, copy the first  error message and bring it back — that will be the next root
cause to handle.
F A Q 	 ( q u e st i o n s	 y o u 	 a r e 	 l i k e l y 	 t o 	 a sk ,	 a n s w e r e d 	 d i r e ct l y )
Q:	Why	does	Gradle	say	a	plugin	artifact	is	incompatible	with	my	build	JVM?
A: The logs show the plugin artifacts declare compatibility with Java 17 while your build JVM was Java
11. Gradle refuses to resolve variants that are declared for a different Java target. To resolve, make
Gradle use JDK 17 or use plugin versions compiled for Java 11—your logs show the artifact variants
are Java 17.
Q:	include_flutter.groovy 	is	missing;	how	do	I	get	it?
A: From your Flutter module folder (coinbyte_flutter_entry ), run flutter pub get  and then fl
utter build aar  (or flutter build apk ) to generate the .android  directory and include_flutt
er.groovy . If pub get  fails, fix local path dependencies first (your logs show fiat_module  path
missing).

browsing behavior or unique IDs on this site. Not consenting or withdrawing consent, may
adversely af fect certain features and functions.
Q:	Why	am	I	seeing	Unresolved reference: filePermissions 	inside	FlutterPlugin.kt ?
A: The Kotlin compile target was too low (jvmTarget 1.8) while compileJava targeted Java 11 or
higher, causing inconsistent visibility for APIs used by the Flutter Gradle plugin Kotlin code. Align
Kotlin jvmTarget and Java target (set both to 17 as shown) and the unresolved references go away.
Q:	My	BR	import	can’t	resolve	(import jp.co.huobi.japan.BR; ).	What	does	that	mean?
A: BR is the DataBinding generated class. If DataBinding is not enabled or layout files are not using
<layout>  root tags, BR will not be generated. Ensure buildFeatures { dataBinding true }  and
correct module namespace  if necessary.
Q:	Can	I	avoid	installing	JDK	17	and	just	downgrade	the	plugins?
A: Only if the plugin artifacts you use have versions compiled to be compatible with Java 11. Your logs
indicate certain plugin versions are Java 17; if a Java-11-compatible release exists, you could switch
to it. Otherwise, make Gradle run with Java 17.

Everything in this post comes exactly from your provided build logs and the configuration snippets
that appeared in the interactions. The instructions and configuration excerpts above are the practical
actions and minimal changes that directly address each quoted error in your logs: Java version
mismatches on dependency resolution, missing Flutter include files caused by local package absence,
Kotlin and Java target inconsistencies, and the missing AGP classpath causing com.android.library
plugin errors.
If you need, paste the outputs of:
1. java -version
2. ./gradlew -version
3. the top ~120 lines of your root build.gradle
4. the gradle.properties  file
— and I will produce the exact patch / diff to apply to those files so you can test with a single apply-
and-build iteration.
