The Python TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable is an exception that occurs when
trying to loop through an integer value. In Python, looping through an object requires the object
to be “iterable”. Since integers are not iterable objects, looping over an integer raises the
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable exception.

Here’s an example of a Python TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable thrown when trying
iterate over an integer value:
myint = 10
for i in myint:
    print(i)
In the above example, myint is attempted to be iterated over. Since myint is an integer and
not an iterable object, iterating over it raises a TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable:
File "test.py", line 3, in <module>
    for i in myint:
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
How to Fix TypeEr ror: Int Object Is Not
Iterable
In the above example, myint cannot be iterated over since it is an integer value. The Python
range() function can be used here to get an iterable object that contains a sequence of
numbers starting from 0 and stopping before the speciﬁed number.
Updating the above example to use the range() function in the for loop ﬁxes the error:
myint = 10
for i in range(myint):
    print(i)
Running the above code produces the following output as expected:
0
1
2
3

How to Avoid TypeError: Int Object Is Not
Iterable
The Python TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable error can be avoided by checking if a
value is an integer or not before iterating over it.
Using the above approach, a check can be added to the earlier example:
myint = 10
if isinstance(myint, int):
    print("Cannot iterate over an integer")
else:
    for i in myint:
        print(i)
A try-except block can also be used to catch and handle the error if the type of object not
known beforehand:
myint = 10
try:
    for i in myint:
        print(i)
except TypeError:
    print("Object must be an iterable")
Surrounding the code in try-except blocks like the above allows the program to continue
execution after the exception is encountered:
