Java Exception Handling
In the last tutorial, we learned about Java exceptions (/java-
programming/exceptions). We know that exceptions abnormally terminate the
execution of a program.
This is why it is important to handle exceptions. Here's a list of different
approaches to handle exceptions in Java.
try...catch block
finally block
throw and throws keyword
1. Java try...catch block
The try-catch (/java-programming/try-catch) block is used to handle exceptions
in Java. Here's the syntax of try...catch  block:
try {
  // code
}
catch(Exception e) {
  // code
}
Here, we have placed the code that might generate an exception inside the try
block. Every try block is followed by a catch  block.Thank you for printing our content at www.domain-name.com. Please check back soon for new

When an exception occurs, it is caught by the catch  block. The catch  block
cannot be used without the try block.
Example: Exception handling using try...catch
Run Code (/java-programming/online-compiler)
Output
ArithmeticException => / by zero
In the example, we are trying to divide a number by 0. Here, this code generates
an exception.
To handle the exception, we have put the code, 5 / 0  inside the try block. Now
when an exception occurs, the rest of the code inside the try block is skipped.
The catch  block catches the exception and statements inside the catch block is
executed.
If none of the statements in the try block generates an exception, the catch
block is skipped.class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args)  {
    try {
      // code that generate exception
      int divideByZero = 5 / 0;
      System.out.println( "Rest of code in try block" );
    }
    
    catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println( "ArithmeticException => "  + e.getMessage());
    }
  }
}

2. Java finally block
In Java, the finally  block is always executed no matter whether there is an
exception or not.
The finally  block is optional. And, for each try block, there can be only one
finally  block.
The basic syntax of finally  block is:
try {
  //code
}
catch (ExceptionType1 e1) { 
  // catch block
}
finally {
  // finally block always executes
}
If an exception occurs, the finally  block is executed after the try...catch
block. Otherwise, it is executed after the try block. For each try block, there can
be only one finally  block.Thank you for printing our content at www.domain-name.com. Please check back soon for new

Run Code (/java-programming/online-compiler)
Output
ArithmeticException => / by zero
This is the finally block
In the above example, we are dividing a number by 0 inside the try block. Here,
this code generates an ArithmeticException .
The exception is caught by the catch  block. And, then the finally  block is
executed.
Note: It is a good practice to use the finally  block. It is because it can
include important cleanup codes like,
code that might be accidentally skipped by return, continue (/java-
programming/continue-statement) or break (/java-
programming/break-statement)
closing a file or connectionclass Main {
  public static void main(String[] args)  {
    try {
      // code that generates exception
      int divideByZero = 5 / 0;
    }
    catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println( "ArithmeticException => "  + e.getMessage());
    }
    
    finally {
      System.out.println( "This is the finally block" );
    }
  }
}

3. Java throw and throws keyword
The Java throw  keyword is used to explicitly throw a single exception.
When we throw  an exception, the flow of the program moves from the try
block to the catch  block.
Example: Exception handling using Java throw
Run Code (/java-programming/online-compiler)
Output
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Trying to divide by 0
        at Main.divideByZero(Main.java:5)
        at Main.main(Main.java:9)
In the above example, we are explicitly throwing the ArithmeticException  using
the throw  keyword.
Similarly, the throws  keyword is used to declare the type of exceptions that
might occur within the method. It is used in the method declaration.class Main {
  public static void divideByZero () {
    // throw an exception
    throw new ArithmeticException( "Trying to divide by 0" );
  }
  public static void main(String[] args)  {
    divideByZero();
  }
}

Example: Java throws keyword
Run Code (/java-programming/online-compiler)
Output
java.io.FileNotFoundException: test.txt (The system cannot find the file specifi
When we run this program, if the file test.txt does not exist, FileInputStream
throws a FileNotFoundException  which extends the IOException  class.
The findFile()  method specifies that an IOException  can be thrown. The
main()  method calls this method and handles the exception if it is thrown.
If a method does not handle exceptions, the type of exceptions that may occur
within it must be specified in the throws  clause.
To learn more, visit Java throw and throws (/java-programming/throw-throws).import java.io.*;
class Main {
  // declareing the type of exception
  public static void findFile () throws IOException {
    // code that may generate IOException
    File newFile = new File("test.txt" );
    FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(newFile);
  }
  public static void main(String[] args)  {
    try {
      findFile();
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
      System.out.println(e);
    }
  }
}
