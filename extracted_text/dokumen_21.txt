How to Fix: PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission Denied in Python
Last Updated : 23 Jul, 2025
When your Python code encounters a situation where it lacks the necessary permissions to access a file or
directory, it raises PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied in Python. This article will explore how to
address the Errno 13 Error in Python effectively.
What is PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission Denied in Python?
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission Denied denotes a situation where a program attempts to execute an
operation—such as file reading or writing—without the requisite permissions. This error typically arises when a
user lacks the necessary privileges to access, modify, or execute a particular file or directory. The error
message associated with Errno 13 explicitly indicates that permission is denied for the specified operation.
Error Syntax
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
below, are the reasons for the occurrence of PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied in Python:
Improper File Path Handling
Incorrect File Content in Python
Improper File Path Handling
This Python code opens a file named "GFG.txt" for writing and writes "Hello, world!" into it. However, the file
path contains backslashes (\), which might cause issues if not handled correctly.
Output:
Incorrect File Content with Python
Below, code to overwrite the content of a file named "GFG.txt" located at a specific path. If executed without
sufficient permissions, Python will raise a PermissionError (Error 13) indicating a permission denied error.with open(r"C:\Users\R.Daswanta kumar\OneDrive\Pictures\GFG\file\GFG.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")
file_path = r"C:\Users\R.Daswanta kumar\OneDrive\Pictures\GFG\file\GFG.txt"
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
    new_content = "New content to replace the existing content."
    file.write(new_content)
print("File content modified successfully!")Python Tutorial Data Types Interview Questions Examples Quizzes DSA Python Data Science NumPy Pandas Practice

Solution for PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission Denied in Python
Below, are the approaches to solve PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission Denied in Python:
Proper File Path Handling
Correct File Content in Python
Proper File Path Handling
Below, code defines a file path and opens a file named "GFG.txt" in write mode, enabling it to overwrite
existing content. It then replaces the content with the specified new text and confirms successful modification.
Output
File content modified successfully
Correct File Content in Python
The following code first checks if the file exists, then attempts to modify its permissions to allow writing. If
successful, it proceeds to overwrite the file's content with new text. If the user lacks necessary permissions, it
prints a message indicating permission denial. Finally, it confirms both the modification of file permissions and
the content.
Output
File content modified successfullyfile_path = r"C:\Users\R.Daswanta kumar\OneDrive\Pictures\GFG\file\GFG.txt"
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
    new_content = "New content to replace the existing content."
    file.write(new_content)
print("File content modified successfully!")
import os
file_path = r"C:\Users\R.Daswanta kumar\OneDrive\Pictures\GFG\file\GFG.txt"
try:
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        os.chmod(file_path, 0o666)
        print("File permissions modified successfully!")
    else:
        print("File not found:", file_path)
except PermissionError:
    print("Permission denied: You don't have the necessary permissions to change the permissions of this file.")
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
    new_content = "New content to replace the existing content."
    file.write(new_content)
print("File content modified successfully!")

In conclusion , To sum up, Error 13 is a frequent Python issue that arises from inadequate permissions when
attempting to access certain files or folders. You may simply fix this problem and create reliable Python code
by using the 'os' module, comprehending file permissions, and putting appropriate error handling in place.
