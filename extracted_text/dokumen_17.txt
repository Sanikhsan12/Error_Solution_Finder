This unfortunate hint to ask here is unfortunately shown on any failed Gradle build, even if it is not at all
a Gradle problem. In your case what you showed says that the task :app:compileFlutterBuildDebug  is
failing, so you probably have some problem in some code you try to compile and not a Gradle problem.
Just scroll up and you probably see the actual error.FAILURE: Build failed with an exception. Exception: Gradle
task assembleDebug failed with exit code 1
