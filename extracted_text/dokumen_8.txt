SQL - Injection
What is SQL Injection?
SQL Injection  is a w ay for hack ers to trick a website into giving them access to data they are not
supposed to see. W ebsites use databases to store things lik e usernames, passwords, and other
information.
Normally , when y ou type into a form (lik e a login bo x), the website sends y our input to the
database. If the website doesn't check y our input properly , a hack er can t ype in special commands
instead of normal text, and the database will follow those commands.
In simple words, SQL Injection happens when a website trusts user input too much and doesn't
clean or check it before using it in the database.This is dangerous because it can let attack ers see priv ate data.
It can allow them to log in without a password.
They can change or delete information.
In some cases, attack ers can ev en tak e control of the system.

How SQL Injection Works
SQL Injection occurs when a website directly uses what a user t ypes into a form inside a database
query , without checking it first. This means the database might accidentally treat the user's input
as a command instead of just text.
For example, imagine a login form where the website tak es the username and password and puts
them str aight into a query . If a hack er types in special symbols or commands instead of normal
text, the database can be trick ed into giving access without the real password. consider the
following PHP code snippet that checks user login:
<?php
// Vulnerable code
$username  = $_POST['username' ];
$password  = $_POST['password' ];
$query = "SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE USERNAME = ' $username ' AND PASSWORD = ' $password '";
$result = mysqli_query ($conn, $query);
?>
If a malicious user enters ' OR '1'='1  as the password, the query becomes:
SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE USERNAME = 'admin' AND PASSWORD = '' OR '1'='1';
This condition is alw ays true because '1'='1'  evaluates to true, allowing the attack er to log in
without knowing the actual password.
Types of SQL Injection
Following are different t ypes of SQL injection:
Classic SQL Injection:  The hacker directly adds bad commands into a database query to
make it do things it shouldn't.
Union-Based SQL Injection:  The hacker uses the UNION  command to get information
from other tables in the database.
Error-Based SQL Injection:  The hacker looks at error messages from the database to
learn secret information about it.
Blind SQL Injection:  The hacker can't see error messages, so they guess information by
watching how the website beha ves (lik e true/false responses, time dela ys, etc.).

Example: Error -Based SQL Injection
Let's sa y we ha ve a table called CUSTOMERS  that stores customer details lik e name, age,
address, and salary . We can create it using this query:
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
   ID INT NOT NULL ,
   NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL ,
   AGE INT NOT NULL ,
   ADDRESS CHAR (25),
   SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
Now, let us insert few records into this table using the INSER T statement as follows:
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES 
(1, 'Ramesh' , 32, 'Ahmedabad' , 2000.00 ),
(2, 'Khilan' , 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 ),
(3, 'Kaushik' , 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 ),
(4, 'Chaitali' , 25, 'Mumbai' , 6500.00 ),
(5, 'Hardik' , 27, 'Bhopal' , 8500.00 ),
(6, 'Komal', 22, 'Hyderabad' , 4500.00 ),
(7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore' , 10000.00  );
The table will be created as follows:
ID NAME AGE ADDRESS SALARY
1 Ramesh 32 Ahmedabad 2000.00
2 Khilan 25 Delhi 1500.00
3 Kaushik 23 Kota 2000.00
4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500.00
5 Hardik 27 Bhopal 8500.00
6 Komal 22 Hyderabad 4500.00
7 Muffy 24 Indore 10000.00
Imagine a website uses this query to get a customer's name and salary b y ID:
Page 4 of 6
SELECT NAME, SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = '1';
If a hack er types 1 OR 1=1  instead of a normal ID , the query becomes:
SELECT NAME, SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = 1 OR 1=1;
Because 1=1 is alw ays true, the database returns all rows  instead of just one record, exposing
everyone's information:
ID NAME AGE ADDRESS SALARY
1 Ramesh 32 Ahmedabad 2000.00
2 Khilan 25 Delhi 1500.00
3 Kaushik 23 Kota 2000.00
4 Chaitali 25 Mumbai 6500.00
5 Hardik 27 Bhopal 8500.00
6 Komal 22 Hyderabad 4500.00
7 Muffy 24 Indore 10000.00
How to Prevent SQL Injection
Following are the best w ays to prev ent SQL Injection:
Example of a Safe Query (Prepared Statement)Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries):  Make sure user input is treated
only as data, not as part of the database commands.
Use Stored Procedures:  Keep SQL code inside the database instead of building queries
with user input.
Validate and Clean Input:  Always check and clean what users type before using it in
queries.
Give Minimum Permissions:  Give database accounts only the access they really need.
Use ORM Libraries:  Tools lik e Hibernate or Entit y Framework handle SQL safely for y ou.
Turn Off Detailed Error Messages:  Don't show database errors to users, so hackers
can't learn about the database.

CERTIFICATIONS COMPILERS & EDITORSIn this example, the website uses a prepared statement . The question marks ? act as
placeholders for user input. Then, the bind_param  function safely attaches the username and
password to the query .
This ensures that no matter what the user t ypes, it is treated only as data and cannot change
the structure of the SQL query . As a result, SQL Injection attacks are prev ented, making the
application much safer .
<?php
// Safe code using prepared statements
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE USERNAME = ? AND PASSWORD = ?" );
$stmt->bind_param ("ss", $username , $password );
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result ();
?>
Here, user inputs are safely bound to the query , eliminating the risk of injection.
Conclusion
SQL Injection is a v ery common and serious securit y problem that can let attack ers access or
change y our data. Dev elopers can protect their websites b y following simple safet y steps lik e using
prepared statements, checking and cleaning user input, and giving database accounts only the
access they need. By doing these things, applications become much safer from SQL Injection
attacks.
