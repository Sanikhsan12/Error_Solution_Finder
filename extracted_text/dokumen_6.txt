C++ Exception Hand ling
An ex ception is a problem that arises during the ex ecution of a progr am. A C++ ex ception is a
response to an ex ceptional circumstance that arises while a progr am is running, such as an
attempt to divide b y zero.
Exceptions pro vide a w ay to tr ansfer control from one part of a progr am to another . C++ ex ception
handling is built upon three k eywords: try, catch,  and throw .
Assuming a block will r aise an ex ception, a method catches an ex ception using a combination of
the try and catch  keywords. A try/catch block is placed around the code that might gener ate an
exception. Code within a try/catch block is referred to as protected code, and the syntax for using
try/catch as follows −
try {
   // protected code
} catch( ExceptionName e1 ) {
   // catch block
} catch( ExceptionName e2 ) {
   // catch block
} catch( ExceptionName eN ) {
   // catch block
}throw  − A progr am throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a
throw  keyword.
catch  − A progr am catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a
progr am where you want to handl e the problem. The catch  keyword indicates the catching
of an ex ception.
try − A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions will be activated.

You can list down multiple catch  statements to catch different t ype of ex ceptions in case y our try
block r aises more than one ex ception in different situations.
Throwing Exceptions
Exceptions can be thrown an ywhere within a code block using throw  statement. The oper and of
the throw statement determines a t ype for the ex ception and can be an y expression and the t ype
of the result of the expression determines the t ype of ex ception thrown.
Example
Following is an example of throwing an ex ception when dividing b y zero condition occurs −
double division (int a, int b) {
   if( b == 0 ) {
      throw "Division by zero condition!" ;
   }
   return (a/b);
}
Catching Exceptions
The catch  block following the try block catches an y exception. Y ou can specif y what t ype of
exception y ou want to catch and this is determined b y the ex ception declar ation that appears in
parentheses following the k eyword catch.Advertisement

Page 3 of 7
try {
   // protected code
} catch( ExceptionName e ) {
  // code to handle ExceptionName exception
}
Above code will catch an ex ception of ExceptionName  type. If y ou want to specif y that a catch
block should handle an y type of ex ception that is thrown in a try block, y ou must put an ellipsis,
..., between the parentheses enclosing the ex ception declar ation as follows −
try {
   // protected code
} catch(...) {
  // code to handle any exception
}
Example
The following is an example, which throws a division b y zero ex ception and we catch it in catch
block.
#include <iostream>
using namespace  std;
double division (int a, int b) {
   if( b == 0 ) {
      throw "Division by zero condition!" ;
   }
   return (a/b);
}
int main () {
   int x = 50;
   int y = 0;
   double z = 0;
 
   try {
      z = division (x, y);
      cout << z << endl;
   } catch (const char* msg) {
Page 4 of 7
     cerr << msg << endl;
   }
   return 0;
}
Because we are r aising an ex ception of t ype const char* , so while catching this ex ception, we
have to use const char* in catch block. If we compile and run abo ve code, this would produce the
following result −
Division by zero condition!
C++ Standard Exceptions
C++ pro vides a list of standard ex ceptions defined in <exception>  which we can use in our
progr ams. These are arr anged in a parent -child class hier archy shown below −
Here is the small description of each ex ception mentioned in the abo ve hier archy −

Page 5 of 7
1std::exception
An ex ception and parent class of all the standard C++ ex ceptions.
2std::bad_alloc
This can be thrown b y new.
3std::bad_cast
This can be thrown b y dynamic_cast .
4std::bad_exception
This is useful device to handle unexpected ex ceptions in a C++ progr am.
5std::bad_typeid
This can be thrown b y typeid .
6std::logic_error
An ex ception that theoretically can be detected b y reading the code.
7std::domain_error
This is an ex ception thrown when a mathematically in valid domain is used.
8std::invalid_argument
This is thrown due to in valid arguments.
9std::length_error
This is thrown when a too big std::string is created.
10std::out_of_range
This can be thrown b y the 'at' method, for example a std::v ector and
std::bitset<>::oper ator[]().
11std::runtime_error
An ex ception that theoretically cannot be detected b y reading the code.
12std::overflow_error
This is thrown if a mathematical o verflow occurs.
13std::range_error
This is occurred when y ou try to store a v alue which is out of r ange.
14std::underflow_error
This is thrown if a mathematical underflow occurs.

You can define y our own ex ceptions b y inheriting and o verriding exception  class functionalit y.

own ex ception in standard w ay −
#include <iostream>
#include <exception>
using namespace  std;
struct MyException  : public exception  {
   const char * what () const throw () {
      return "C++ Exception" ;
   }
};
 
int main() {
   try {
      throw MyException ();
   } catch(MyException & e) {
      std::cout << "MyException caught"  << std::endl;
      std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
   } catch(std::exception & e) {
      //Other errors
   }
}
This would produce the following result −
MyException caught
C++ Exception
Here, what()  is a public method pro vided b y exception class and it has been o verridden b y all the
child ex ception classes. This returns the cause of an ex ception.
