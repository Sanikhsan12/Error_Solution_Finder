"Unindent does not match any outer
indentation level"
Can anyone explain to me what this message actually means? I have fixed many a problem after
getting this error message, mostly by dumb luck. Often I indent the offending line another way
and get a new error message like “so and so not defined”.
What process does a good coder follow when he or she gets a message lijke that?

If you post your code, we can try to find the problem. So that we can see the indentation you
used, be sure to format it according to the instructions that you can see be clicking the link
that looks like this:

Indentation problems often occur when the code is not indented that is intended to be
controlled by a function header, a loop header, an if block header, or another type of
header. The controlled block of code needs to be indented one level to the right, with respect
to its header.
One significant problem is the mixing of tabs and spaces for indenting code. Use either tabs or
spaces, but not both. Visually, code indented with tabs or spaces is indistinguishable, but you
can check the spacing by clicking on it with your mouse to discern the width of the whitespace
units that are in the code.
Most Python editors have a default mode of spacing, and include some degree of automatic
indentation formatting. Codecademy appears to be using spaces, at present, and automaticallyGo to forums

converts tabs used for formatting into four spaces. The IDLE Python editor that you might have
on your local computer includes menu items that help with indenting.
Sometimes, when I cannot tell whether a sample of Python code on Codecademy or elsewhere
has mixed spaces and tabs, I’ll remove the indentation from each indented line, starting from
the beginning, remove the line feed at the beginning of the line, then hit Enter to have
Codecademy provide default indentation. Corrections concerning the level of indentation may
have to be made along the way, though, so that each line belongs to the proper block. You can
experiment with this on Codecademy to find out what works best for you.

OK, here is my latest code starting with lines 11 through 14 which passed on the last exercise:
class PartTimeEmployee(Employee): def calculate_wage(self,hours): self.hours=hours return
hours * 12.00 def full_time_wage(self,hours): self.hours=hours return
super(PartTimeEmployee,self).calculate_wage(self,hours) Milton = PartTimeEmpolyee(“Milton”)
print full_time_wage(milton,10)
and that returns:
“syntax error. return outside function”
That’s my latest code. It doesn’t live up to the original title of this thread but I still have a
problem getting my brain around what these error messages mean and what you think about
when you get certan ones (especially ones like “expected indent, unexpected indent, not
defined, etc.). I get those all the time. I understand the indent from the standpoint of if and else
statements in a function. You do this if it’s inside the function. That makes sense. But how the
indent determines whether or not something is defined or not (when I can see a statement I
just wrote that says “def xyz”), that just baffles me.

Thank you Glenn, I finally solved the problem. I always try to use a hard return when possible
and I always use four spaces per indent. That was really good advice you gave about that. But
sometimes the error implicates indents when I think the interpreter is confused by some other
bug. You fix the indent like it likes and that reveals some subtler flaw that makes it think
something is not defined for example when you can see in the text that it is defined (at least in
the human sense of a statement like def xyz:
What got me through this one was changing my return super code to … (PartTimeEmployee,
self).calculate_wage(hours)
