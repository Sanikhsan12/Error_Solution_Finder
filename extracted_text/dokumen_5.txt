Java - Exceptions
What Is an Exception in Java?
An ex ception (or ex ceptional ev ent) is a problem that arises during the ex ecution of a progr am.
When an Exception  occurs the normal flow of the progr am is disrupted and the
progr am/Application terminates abnormally , which is not recommended, therefore, these
exceptions are to be handled.
Why Exception Occurs?
An ex ception can occur for man y different reasons. F ollowing are some scenarios where an
exception occurs.Advertisement

Some of these ex ceptions are caused b y user error , others b y progr ammer error , and others b y
physical resources that ha ve failed in some manner .
Java Exception Categories
Based on these, we ha ve the following categories of Ex ceptions. Y ou need to understand them to
know how ex ception handling works in Ja va.
Java Check ed Ex ceptions
A check ed ex ception is an ex ception that is check ed (notified) b y the compiler at compilation-time,
these are also called as compile time ex ceptions. These ex ceptions cannot simply be ignored, the
progr ammer should tak e care of (handle) these ex ceptions.
Example: Check ed Ex ceptions in Ja va
For example, if y ou use FileReader  class in y our progr am to read data from a file, if the file
specified in its constructor doesn't exist, then a FileNotF oundEx ception  occurs, and the compiler
prompts the progr ammer to handle the ex ception.
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader ;
public class FilenotFound_Demo  {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      File file = new File("E://file.txt" );
      FileReader  fr = new FileReader (file); 
   }
}
If you try to compile the abo ve progr am, y ou will get the following ex ceptions.A network connection has been lost in the middle of communicati ons or the JVM has run
out of memory .

      FileReader fr = new FileReader(file);
                      ^
1 error
Note  − Since the methods read()  and close()  of FileR eader class throws IOEx ception, y ou can
observ e that the compiler notifies to handle IOEx ception, along with FileNotF oundEx ception.
Java Uncheck ed Ex ceptions
An uncheck ed ex ception is an ex ception that occurs at the time of ex ecution. These are also called
as Runtime Ex ceptions. These include progr amming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of
an API. R untime ex ceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.
Example: Uncheck ed Ex ceptions in Ja va
For example, if y ou ha ve declared an arr ay of siz e 5 in y our progr am, and trying to call the 6
element of the arr ay then an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsEx ceptionex ception  occurs.
public class Unchecked_Demo  {
   
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int num[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
      System.out.println(num[5]);
   }
}
If you compile and ex ecute the abo ve progr am, y ou will get the following ex ception.
Output
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5
at Exceptions.Unchecked_Demo.main(Unchecked_Demo.java:8)
Java Errorsth

These are not ex ceptions at all, but problems that arise bey ond the control of the user or the
progr ammer . Errors are t ypically ignored in y our code because y ou can r arely do an ything about an
error. For example, if a stack o verflow occurs, an error will arise. They are also ignored at the time
of compilation.
Java Exception Hierarchy
All ex ception classes are subt ypes of the ja va.lang.Ex ception class. The ex ception class is a
subclass of the Throw able class . Other than the ex ception class there is another subclass called
Error which is deriv ed from the Throw able class.
Errors are abnormal conditions that happen in case of sev ere failures, these are not handled b y the
Java progr ams. Errors are gener ated to indicate errors gener ated b y the runtime en vironment.
Example: JVM is out of memory . Normally , progr ams cannot reco ver from errors.
The Ex ception class has two main subclasses: IOEx ception class and R untimeEx ception Class.
Following is a list of most common check ed and uncheck ed Java's Built -in Ex ceptions .
Java Exception Class Methods
Following is the list of important methods a vailable in the Throw able class.
Sr.No. Method & Description
1public String getMessage()
Returns a detailed message about the ex ception that has occurred. This message is
initializ ed in the Throw able constructor .
2public Throwable getCause()
Returns the cause of the ex ception as represented b y a Throw able object.
3 public String toString()
Page 5 of 16
Returns the name of the class concatenated with the result of getMessage().
4public void printStackTrace()
Prints the result of toString() along with the stack tr ace to S ystem.err , the error output
stream.
5public StackTraceElement [] getStackTrace()
Returns an arr ay containing each element on the stack tr ace. The element at index 0
represents the top of the call stack, and the last element in the arr ay represents the
method at the bottom of the call stack.
6public Throwable fillInStackTrace()
Fills the stack tr ace of this Throw able object with the current stack tr ace, adding to an y
previous information in the stack tr ace.
Catching Exceptions: Exception Handling in Java
A method catches an ex ception using a combination of the try and catch  keywords. A try/catch
block is placed around the code that might gener ate an ex ception. Code within a try/catch block is
referred to as protected code, and the syntax for using try/catch looks lik e the following −
Syntax
try {
   // Protected code
} catch (ExceptionName  e1) {
   // Catch block
}
The code which is prone to ex ceptions is placed in the try block. When an ex ception occurs, that
exception occurred is handled b y catch block associated with it. Ev ery try block should be
immediately followed either b y a catch block or finally block.
A catch statement in volves declaring the t ype of ex ception y ou are trying to catch. If an ex ception
occurs in protected code, the catch block (or blocks) that follows the try is check ed. If the t ype of
exception that occurred is listed in a catch block, the ex ception is passed to the catch block much
as an argument is passed into a method par ameter .
Example: Demonstr ating Ex ception Handling
In following example, an arr ay is declared with 2 elements. Then the code tries to access the 3
element of the arr ay which throws an ex ception.rd
Page 6 of 16
// File Name : ExcepTest.java
import java.io.*;
public class ExcepTest  {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      try {
         int a[] = new int[2];
         System.out.println("Access element three :"  + a[3]);
      } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  e) {
         System.out.println("Exception thrown  :"  + e);
      }
      System.out.println("Out of the block" );
   }
}
Output
Exception thrown  :java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 3
Out of the block
Multiple Catch Blocks
A try block can be followed b y multiple catch blocks. The syntax for multiple catch blocks looks lik e
the following −
Syntax
try {
   // Protected code
} catch (ExceptionType1  e1) {
   // Catch block
} catch (ExceptionType2  e2) {
   // Catch block
} catch (ExceptionType3  e3) {
   // Catch block
}
The previous statements demonstr ate three catch blocks, but y ou can ha ve any number of them
after a single try . If an ex ception occurs in the protected code, the ex ception is thrown to the first
catch block in the list. If the data t ype of the ex ception thrown matches Ex ceptionT ype1, it gets
Page 7 of 16
caught there. If not, the ex ception passes down to the second catch statement. This continues
until the ex ception either is caught or falls through all catches, in which case the current method
stops ex ecution and the ex ception is thrown down to the previous method on the call stack.
Example
Here is code segment showing how to use multiple try/catch statements.
try {
   file = new FileInputStream (fileName );
   x = (byte) file.read();
} catch (IOException  i) {
   i.printStackTrace ();
   return -1;
} catch (FileNotFoundException  f) // Not valid! {
   f.printStackTrace ();
   return -1;
}
Catching Multiple Type of Exceptions
Since Ja va 7, y ou can handle more than one ex ception using a single catch block, this feature
simplifies the code. Here is how y ou would do it −
catch (IOException|FileNotFoundException ex) {
   logger.log(ex);
   throw ex;
The Throws/Throw Keywords
If a method does not handle a check ed ex ception, the method must declare it using the throws
keyword. The throws k eyword appears at the end of a method's signature.
You can throw an ex ception, either a newly instantiated one or an ex ception that y ou just caught,
by using the throw  keyword.
Try to understand the difference between throws and throw k eywords, throws  is used to postpone
the handling of a check ed ex ception and throw  is used to in voke an ex ception explicitly .
The following method declares that it throws a R emoteEx ception −
Example
Page 8 of 16
import java.io.*;
public class className {
   public void deposit(double amount) throws RemoteException  {
      // Method implementation
      throw new RemoteException ();
   }
   // Remainder of class definition
}
A method can declare that it throws more than one ex ception, in which case the ex ceptions are
declared in a list separ ated b y commas. F or example, the following method declares that it throws
a RemoteEx ception and an InsufficientFundsEx ception −
Example
import java.io.*;
public class className {
   public void withdraw (double amount) throws RemoteException , 
      InsufficientFundsException  {
      // Method implementation
   }
   // Remainder of class definition
}
The Finally Block
The finally block follows a try block or a catch block. A finally block of code alw ays ex ecutes,
irrespectiv e of occurrence of an Ex ception.
Using a finally block allows y ou to run an y cleanup-t ype statements that y ou want to ex ecute, no
matter what happens in the protected code.
A finally block appears at the end of the catch blocks and has the following syntax −
Syntax
try {
   // Protected code
} catch (ExceptionType1  e1) {
   // Catch block
Page 9 of 16
} catch (ExceptionType2  e2) {
   // Catch block
} catch (ExceptionType3  e3) {
   // Catch block
}finally {
   // The finally block always executes.
}
Example
public class ExcepTest  {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int a[] = new int[2];
      try {
         System.out.println("Access element three :"  + a[3]);
      } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  e) {
         System.out.println("Exception thrown  :"  + e);
      }finally {
         a[0] = 6;
         System.out.println("First element value: "  + a[0]);
         System.out.println("The finally statement is executed" );
      }
   }
}
Output
Exception thrown  :java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 3
First element value: 6
The finally statement is executed
Note the following −

The try-with-resources
Gener ally, when we use an y resources lik e streams, connections, etc. we ha ve to close them
explicitly using finally block. In the following progr am, we are reading data from a file using
FileReader  and we are closing it using finally block.
Example
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader ;
import java.io.IOException ;
public class ReadData_Demo  {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      FileReader  fr = null;
      try {
         File file = new File("file.txt" );
         fr = new FileReader (file); char [] a = new char[50];
         fr.read(a);   // reads the content to the array
         for(char c : a)
         System.out.print(c);   // prints the characters one by one
      } catch (IOException  e) {
         e.printStackTrace ();
      }finally {
         try {
            fr.close();
         } catch (IOException  ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace ();
         }
      }
   }
}
try-with-resources , also referred as automatic resource management , is a new ex ception
handling mechanism that w as introduced in Ja va 7, which automatically closes the resources usedA catch clause cannot exist without a try statement.
It is not compulsory to ha ve finally clauses whenev er a try/catch block is present.
The try block cannot be present without either catch clause or finally clause.
Any code cannot be present in between the try , catch, finally blocks.
Page 11 of 16
within the try catch block.
To use this statement, y ou simply need to declare the required resources within the parenthesis,
and the created resource will be closed automatically at the end of the block. F ollowing is the
syntax of try -with-resources statement.
Syntax
try(FileReader  fr = new FileReader ("file path" )) {
   // use the resource
   } catch () {
      // body of catch 
   }
}
Following is the progr am that reads the data in a file using try -with-resources statement.
Example
import java.io.FileReader ;
import java.io.IOException ;
public class Try_withDemo  {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      try(FileReader  fr = new FileReader ("E://file.txt" )) {
         char [] a = new char[50];
         fr.read(a);   // reads the contentto the array
         for(char c : a)
         System.out.print(c);   // prints the characters one by one
      } catch (IOException  e) {
         e.printStackTrace ();
      }
   }
}
Following points are to be k ept in mind while working with try -with-resources statement.
To use a class with try-with-res ources statement it should implement AutoCloseable
interface and the close()  method of it gets in voked automatically at runtime.
You can declare more than one class in try -with-resources statement.
Page 12 of 16
User-deﬁned Exceptions in Java
You can create y our own ex ceptions in Ja va. Keep the following points in mind when writing y our
own ex ception classes −
Syntax
We can define our own Ex ception class as below −
class MyException  extends Exception  {
}
You just need to extend the predefined Exception  class to create y our own Ex ception. These are
considered to be check ed ex ceptions. The following InsufficientFundsException  class is a user -
defined ex ception that extends the Ex ception class, making it a check ed ex ception. An ex ception
class is lik e any other class, containing useful fields and methods.
Example: Creating user -defined ex ception
// File Name InsufficientFundsException.java
import java.io.*;
public class InsufficientFundsException  extends Exception  {
   private double amount;
   
   public InsufficientFundsException (double amount) {
      this.amount = amount;
   }
   While you declare multiple classes in the try block of try-with-res ources statement these
classes are closed in rev erse order .
Except the declar ation of resources within the parenthesis everything is the same as
normal try/catch block of a try block.
The resource declared in try gets instantiated just before the start of the try -block.
The resource declared at the try block is implicitly declared as final.
All ex ceptions must be a child of Throw able.
If you want to write a check ed exception that is automatically enforced by the Handle or
Declare R ule, y ou need to extend the Ex ception class.
If you want to write a runtime ex ception, y ou need to extend the R untimeEx ception class.
Page 13 of 16
   public double getAmount () {
      return amount;
   }
}
To demonstr ate using our user -defined ex ception, the following CheckingAccount class contains a
withdr aw() method that throws an InsufficientFundsEx ception.
// File Name CheckingAccount.java
import java.io.*;
public class CheckingAccount  {
   private double balance ;
   private int number;
   
   public CheckingAccount (int number) {
      this.number = number;
   }
   
   public void deposit(double amount) {
      balance += amount;
   }
   
   public void withdraw (double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException  {
      if(amount <= balance ) {
         balance -= amount;
      }else {
         double needs = amount - balance ;
         throw new InsufficientFundsException (needs);
      }
   }
   
   public double getBalance () {
      return balance ;
   }
   
   public int getNumber () {
      return number;
   }
}
The following BankDemo progr am demonstr ates in voking the deposit() and withdr aw() methods of
CheckingAccount.
Page 14 of 16
// File Name BankDemo.java
public class BankDemo  {
   public static void main(String [] args) {
      CheckingAccount  c = new CheckingAccount (101);
      System.out.println("Depositing $500..." );
      c.deposit(500.00);
      
      try {
         System.out.println("\nWithdrawing $100..." );
         c.withdraw (100.00);
         System.out.println("\nWithdrawing $600..." );
         c.withdraw (600.00);
      } catch (InsufficientFundsException  e) {
         System.out.println("Sorry, but you are short $"  + e.getAmount ());
         e.printStackTrace ();
      }
   }
}
Compile all the abo ve three files and run BankDemo . This will produce the following result −
Output
Depositing $500...
Withdrawing $100...
Withdrawing $600...
Sorry, but you are short $200.0
InsufficientFundsException
         at CheckingAccount.withdraw(CheckingAccount.java:25)
         at BankDemo.main(BankDemo.java:13)
Common Java Exceptions
In Java, it is possible to define two catergories of Ex ceptions and Errors.
JVM Exceptions  − These are exceptions/errors that are exclusiv ely or logically thrown by
the JVM. Examples: NullPointerEx ception, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsEx ception,
ClassCastEx ception.
