The JavaScript ReferenceError: $ is not defined occurs when the jQuery library is used but
is not properly loaded or is not available in the current scope of the code.
In JavaScript, the $ symbol is often used as a shorthand alias for the jQuery library. This error
indicates that the code is trying to use jQuery functionality by referencing the $ symbol, but
the library is not available or has not been loaded correctly.

This error can occur for several reasons, such as:
The jQuery library is not included in the script that references it.
The library is included with a typo or error in the script
The script is executed before the jQuery library is loaded, which can be caused by incorrect
placement of the script tag in the HTML ﬁle.
The code is running in a different scope or environment where the $ symbol is not deﬁned
or has a different meaning.
ReferenceError: $ is Not Defined Example
Here’s an example of a Javascript ReferenceError: $ is not defined thrown when jQuery is
not properly loaded in a script that uses it:
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('#myButton').click(function() {
                alert('Button clicked!');
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the code is trying to use the jQuery library. Since jQuery is not included in the
above script, running it throws the error:
Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
How to Fix ReferenceError: $ is Not Defined
JavaScriptTo ﬁx the ReferenceError: $ is not defined error, jQuery should be properly loaded before
any code that references it is executed. This can be done by including the library in the HTML ﬁle
using a script tag, either by downloading the library and hosting it locally or by using a content
delivery network (CDN) link.
Any syntax errors or typos in the script should also be checked, as they may prevent jQuery from
loading correctly.
The earlier example can be updated to ﬁx the error by using the above approach:
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example</title>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('#myButton').click(function() {
                alert('Button clicked!');
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Here, the jQuery library is included using a script tag with a CDN link. This makes it available to
be used in the script, which avoids the ReferenceError: $ is not defined error.
