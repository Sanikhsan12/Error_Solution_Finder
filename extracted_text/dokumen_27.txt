Python indentationerror: unindent does not match any

UPDATEDDECEMBER 1, 2023
Indenting your code can be a messy business if you try to use both spaces and tabs. In
Python, using both methods of indentation results in an error. This error is “indentationerror:
unindent does not match any outer indentation level”.
In this guide, we talk about what this error means and when it is raised. We walk through an
example of this error in action to help you learn how to fix it.
indentationerror: unindent does not match any
outer indentation level
Python code (https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-to-code-in-python/) can be indented with
tabs or spaces. It’s up to you.
Python only has an objection when you use both spaces and tabs to indent your code.
Python requires you use only one method of indentation. This is because the language is
statically typed. Statically typed programming languages are sticklers when it comes to
syntax. 
Indentation errors are a difficult one to understand because it involves the invisible: mixing
spaces and tabs. Depending on the code editor you are using, you may not even be able to
see whether spaces or tabs have been used until you delete your indents from your code.
IndentationErrors are common when you copy code snippets from the internet. Every
developer has their own preference when it comes to indentation and you’ll often find code
snippets do not adhere to your own preferences. Some snippets will indent with spaces.
If a code snippet you copy into your program uses a different type of indentation, you may
see an IndentationError in your code. This is because you mix tabs and spaces.
An Example Scenario
Write a program that finds the factors of a number.
Start by defining a function (https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-functions/) to calculate
the factors of a number:

defget_factors(number):
for i inrange(1, number + 1):
if number % i == 0:
print("{} is a factor of {}.".format(i, number))
This function uses a for loop (https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-for-loop/) to iterate
through every number in the range of 1 and the number we have specified plus 1.
In each iteration, our program checks if there is a remainder after dividing “number” by “i”. We
do this using the modulo operator (https://careerkarma.com/blog/python-modulo/). If there
is not a remainder, “i” is a factor of “number”.
If a number is a factor of “number”, a message is printed to the console.
We to call our function:
get_factors(32)
This code calculates all the factors of 32. Run our code and see what happens:
  File "test.py", line 4
print("{} is a factor of {}.".format(i, number))
^
IndentationError: unindent does notmatch any outer indentation level
Our code returns an IndentationError.
The Solution
We have made a mistake with the styling of our code. We know this because
IndentationErrors are raised when there is a problem with how your code is indented.
Take a look at how our code is styled. In Sublime Text, we can see the styles of our code by
hovering over each line:
Each line represents a tab. Each dot represents a space. You can see that we have mixed up
both spaces and tabs in our code snippet. Python likes consistency in indents and so the
interpreter returns an error when we run our code.
If you use a text editor that does not support this behavior, check whether your code uses
spaces or tabs by backspacing your indentation. If your code removes a tab when you press
the backspace key, that part of your code is using tabs.
Spaces are the preferred method of indentation in Python
(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) but you can use tabs if you want.
Let’s revise our code:
defget_factors(number):
for i inrange(1, number + 1):
if number % i == 0:
print("{} is a factor of {}.".format(i, number))
We have replaced all the spaces with tabs. Run our program again:

logically accurate all along. It was our indentation that caused the problem.
Conclusion
The “indentationerror: unindent does not match any outer indentation level” error is raised
when you use both spaces and tabs to indent your code.
To solve this error, check to make sure that all your code uses either spaces or tabs in a
program. Now you’re ready to resolve this common Python error like a professional software
developer (https://medium.com/careerkarma/python-vs-java-web-development-career-
