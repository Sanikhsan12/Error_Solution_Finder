If you are running your Python code and you see the error
“TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable”, it means you are
trying to loop through an integer or other data type that
loops cannot work on.
In Python, iterable data are lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and so on.
In addition, this error being a “TypeError” means you’re trying to perform
an operation on an inappropriate data type. For example, adding a string
with an integer.
Today is the last day you should get this error while running your Python
code. Because in this article, I will not just show you how to fix it, I will also
show you how to check for the __iter__ magic methods so you can see if
an object is iterable.
How t o Fix Int Object is Not It erable
If you are trying to loop through an integer, you will get this error:
count = 14
for i in count:
    print(i)
# Output: TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
One way to fix it is to pass the variable into the range() function.
In Python, the range function checks the variable passed into it and returns
a series of numbers starting from 0 and stopping right before the specified
number.
The loop will now run:Learn to code — free 3,000-hour curriculum Donate
count = 14
for i in range(count):
    print(i)
# Output: 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
# 11
# 12
# 13
Another example that uses this solution is in the snippet below:
age = int(input("Enter your age: " ))
for num in range(age):
    print(num)
# Output: 
# Enter your age: 6
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
How t o Check if Data or an Object is
Iterable
To check if some particular data are iterable, you can use the dir()
method. If you can see the magic method __iter__, then the data areLearn to code — free 3,000-hour curriculum Donate
iterable. If not, then the data are not iterable and you shouldn’t bother
looping through them.
perfectNum = 7
print(dir(perfectNum ))
# Output:['__abs__', '__add__', '__and__', '__bool__', '__ceil__', '__class__'
# '__pow__', '__radd__', '__rand__', '__rdivmod__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex_
The __iter__ magic method is not found in the output, so the variable
perfectNum is not iterable.
jerseyNums = [43, 10, 7, 6, 8]
print(dir(jerseyNums ))
# Output: ['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__delitem__
The magic method __iter__ was found, so the list jerseyNums is iterable.
Conclusion
In this article, you learned about the “Int Object is Not Iterable” error and
how to fix it.
You were also able to see that it is possible to check whether an object or
some data are iterable or not.
If you check for the __iter__ magic method in some data and you don’t
find it, it’s better to not attempt to loop through the data at all since they're
not iterable.
