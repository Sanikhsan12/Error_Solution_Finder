To whom it may concern,
Please read what I have to say before giving the usual response to this question. I have asked on
multiple Discords after googling for Hours. I am to the point that i am writing on a Python forum to
figure out what the issue could actually be. The screen shots linked will show that not only am I
Admin on my PC, I also have enabled “Full Control” on the hard drive that the files are in. I have
enabled every permission known to me. The files i am trying to read from the drive are indeed
there, and the file location indeed does exist. I have no other editor open with those files, no
excel, or Tiled program open. I have even ran Pycharm as Admin and get the same error . I have
even gone as far as trying to open the files from my D: drive instead of my G: drive. I get the
same error . All i am trying to accomplish is to open a “.tmx” from an export from Tiled to use what
I made as a map in a pygame. I can send any and all Code relating to this in case my coding is
the issue.
I also restarted the Computer multiple times in case the files did not close properly in Tiled.
As a new user , I can only upload one screenshot, I have several I need to share, so i am sharing
the one that shows i am indeed an Admin so that can be cleared up that I have significant
permissions
I appreciate you (anyone) taking the time to help me with this, especially near the holidays
