project, you’re not alone. This common error usually occurs due
to incorrect imports, missing dependencies, or incorrect project
setup. The Dart analyzer throws this error when it can’t find a

Sometimes, a simple cache issue can cause unresolved

Check for Typos in Class or Variable Names
Dart will throw an unresolved reference error if you mistype class
or function names.

For an in-depth look at Dart’s import system and best practices,

By following the steps above, you can systematically eliminate
the causes of this error and get your Dart project running
smoothly again.
