Python - Exceptions Handling
Exception Handling in Python
Exception handling in Python refers to managing runtime errors that ma y occur during the
execution of a progr am. In Python, ex ceptions are r aised when errors or unexpected situations
arise during progr am ex ecution, such as division b y zero, trying to access a file that does not exist,
or attempting to perform an oper ation on incompatible data t ypes.
Python pro vides two v ery important features to handle an y unexpected error in y our Python
progr ams and to add debugging capabilities in them −
Exception Handling  − This would be covered in this tutorial. Here is a list of standa rd
Exceptions a vailable in Python: Standard Ex ceptions .
Assertions  − This would be co vered in Assertions in Python  tutorial.

Assertions in Python
An assertion is a sanit y-check that y ou can turn on or turn off when y ou are done with y our testing
of the progr am.
The easiest w ay to think of an assertion is to lik en it to a raise-if  statement (or to be more
accur ate, a r aise-if -not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an
exception is r aised.
Progr ammers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for v alid input, and after a
function call to check for v alid output.
The assert Statement
When it encounters an assert statement, Python ev aluates the accompan ying expression, which is
hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python r aises an AssertionError  exception.
The syntax  for assert is −
assert Expression [, Arguments ]
If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the AssertionError .
AssertionError ex ceptions can be caught and handled lik e any other ex ception using the try -except
statement, but if not handled, they will terminate the progr am and produce a tr ace back.
Example
Here is a function that con verts a temper ature from degrees K elvin to degrees F ahrenheit. Since
zero degrees K elvin is as cold as it gets, the function bails out if it sees a negativ e temper ature −
def KelvinToFahrenheit (Temperature ):
   assert (Temperature >= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"
   return ((Temperature -273)*1.8)+32
print (KelvinToFahrenheit (273))
print (int(KelvinToFahrenheit (505.78)))
print (KelvinToFahrenheit (-5))Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest keyword to Python,
introduced in version 1.5.

When the abo ve code is ex ecuted, it produces the following result −
32.0
451
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
print (KelvinToFahrenheit(-5))
File "test.py", line 4, in KelvinToFahrenheit
assert (Temperature >= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"
AssertionError: Colder than absolute zero!
What is Exception?
An ex ception is an ev ent, which occurs during the ex ecution of a progr am that disrupts the normal
flow of the progr am's instructions. In gener al, when a Python script encounters a situation that it
cannot cope with, it r aises an ex ception. An ex ception is a Python object that represents an error .
When a Python script r aises an ex ception, it must either handle the ex ception immediately
otherwise it terminates and quits.
Handling an Exception in Python
If you ha ve some suspicious code that ma y raise an ex ception, y ou can defend y our progr am by
placing the suspicious code in a try: block. After the try: block, include an except : statement,
followed b y a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.
Syntax
Here is the simple syntax of try...except...else  blocks −
try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except ExceptionI :
   If there is ExceptionI , then execute this block .
except ExceptionII :
   If there is ExceptionII , then execute this block .
   ......................The try: block contains statements which are susceptible for ex ception
If exception occurs, the progr am jumps to the except : block.
If no ex ception in the try: block, the except : block is skipped.
Page 4 of 12
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block .
Here are few important points about the abo ve-mentioned syntax −
Example
This example opens a file, writes content in the file and comes out gr acefully because there is no
problem at all.
try:
   fh = open("testfile" , "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!" )
except IOError :
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data" )
else:
   print ("Written content in the file successfully" )
   fh.close()
It will produce the following output  −
Written content in the file successfully
Howev er, change the mode par ameter in open() function to "w". If the testfile is not already
present, the progr am encounters IOError in ex cept block, and prints following error message −
Error: can't find file or read data
ExampleA single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try
block contains statements that ma y throw different t ypes of ex ceptions.
You can also pro vide a generic except  clause, which handles an y exception.
After the except clause(s), you can include an else clause. The code in the else block
executes if the code in the try: block does not r aise an ex ception.
The else block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection.
Page 5 of 12
This example tries to open a file where y ou do not ha ve write permission, so it r aises an ex ception
−
try:
   fh = open("testfile" , "r")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!" )
except IOError :
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data" )
else:
   print ("Written content in the file successfully" )
This produces the following result −
Error: can't find file or read data
The except Clause with No Exceptions
You can also use the ex cept statement with no ex ceptions defined as follows −
try:
   You do your operations here ;
   ......................
except:
   If there is any exception , then execute this block .
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block . 
This kind of a try-except  statement catches all the ex ceptions that occur . Using this kind of try -
except statement is not considered a good progr amming pr actice though, because it catches all
exceptions but does not mak e the progr ammer identif y the root cause of the problem that ma y
occur.
The except Clause with Multiple Exceptions
You can also use the same except statement to handle multiple ex ceptions as follows −
try:
   You do your operations here ;
Page 6 of 12
   ......................
except(Exception1 [, Exception2 [,...ExceptionN ]]]):
   If there is any exception from the given exception list, 
   then execute this block .
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block . 
The try-ﬁnally Clause
You can use a finally:  block along with a try: block. The finally block is a place to put an y code
that must ex ecute, whether the try -block r aised an ex ception or not. The syntax of the try -finally
statement is this −
try:
   You do your operations here ;
   ......................
   Due to any exception , this may be skipped .
finally:
   This would always be executed .
   ......................
You cannot use else clause as well along with a finally clause.
Example
try:
   fh = open("testfile" , "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!" )
finally:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data" )
If you do not ha ve permission to open the file in writing mode, then this will produce the following
result −
Error: can't find file or read data
Same example can be written more cleanly as follows −
Page 7 of 12
try:
   fh = open("testfile" , "w")
   try:
      fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!" )
   finally:
      print ("Going to close the file" )
      fh.close()
except IOError :
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data" )
When an ex ception is thrown in the try block, the ex ecution immediately passes to the finally
block. After all the statements in the finally  block are ex ecuted, the ex ception is r aised again and is
handled in the except statements if present in the next higher la yer of the try-except statement.
Argument of an Exception
An ex ception can ha ve an argument , which is a v alue that giv es additional information about the
problem. The contents of the argument v ary by exception. Y ou capture an ex ception's argument b y
supplying a v ariable in the ex cept clause as follows −
try:
   You do your operations here ;
   ......................
except ExceptionType , Argument :
   You can print value of Argument here ...
If you write the code to handle a single ex ception, y ou can ha ve a variable follow the name of the
exception in the ex cept statement. If y ou are tr apping multiple ex ceptions, y ou can ha ve a variable
follow the tuple of the ex ception.
This v ariable receiv es the v alue of the ex ception mostly containing the cause of the ex ception. The
variable can receiv e a single v alue or multiple v alues in the form of a tuple. This tuple usually
contains the error string, the error number , and an error location.
Example
Following is an example for a single ex ception −
Page 8 of 12
# Define a function here.
def temp_convert (var):
   try:
      return int(var)
   except ValueError as Argument :
      print ("The argument does not contain numbers\n" , Argument )
# Call above function here.
temp_convert ("xyz")
This produces the following result −
The argument does not contain numbers
invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'xyz'
Raising an Exceptions
You can r aise ex ceptions in sev eral ways by using the r aise statement. The gener al syntax for the
raise  statement is as follows.
Syntax
raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]
Here, Exception  is the t ype of ex ception (for example, NameError) and argument  is a v alue for the
exception argument. The argument is optional; if not supplied, the ex ception argument is None.
The final argument, tr ace back, is also optional (and r arely used in pr actice), and if present, is the
traceback object used for the ex ception.
Example
An ex ception can be a string, a class or an object. Most of the ex ceptions that the Python core
raises are classes, with an argument that is an instance of the class. Defining new ex ceptions is
quite easy and can be done as follows −
def functionName ( level ):
   if level < 1:
      raise "Invalid level!" , level
      # The code below to this would not be executed
      # if we raise the exception
Page 9 of 12
Note:  In order to catch an ex ception, an "ex cept" clause must refer to the same ex ception thrown
either class object or simple string. F or example, to capture abo ve exception, we must write the
except clause as follows −
try:
   Business Logic here ...
except "Invalid level!" :
   Exception handling here ...
else:
   Rest of the code here ...
User-Deﬁned Exceptions
Python also allows y ou to create y our own ex ceptions b y deriving classes from the standard built -
in exceptions.
Here is an example related to RuntimeError . Here, a class is created that is subclassed from
RuntimeError . This is useful when y ou need to displa y more specific information when an ex ception
is caught.
In the try block, the user -defined ex ception is r aised and caught in the ex cept block. The v ariable e
is used to create an instance of the class Network error.
class Networkerror (RuntimeError ):
   def __init__ (self, arg):
      self.args = arg
So once y ou defined abo ve class, y ou can r aise the ex ception as follows −
try:
   raise Networkerror ("Bad hostname" )
except Networkerror ,e:
   print (e.args)
