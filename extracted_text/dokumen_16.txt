What is Exception: Gradle
task assembleDebug failed
with exit code 1 (again) Error
in Flutter
 
Overview of the Error
 
The error "Exception: Gradle task assembleDebug
failed with exit code 1" indicates a problem within the
build process of a Flutter project, specifically during
the Gradle task that assembles the debug version of
the application.
 
This error halts the compilation of the Flutter app,
preventing developers from running it in a debug
mode for testing purposes.
 
 
Typical Symptoms
 
Flutter commands like `flutter run` or `flutter
build` fail with the mention of this specific Gradle
task error.
 
The terminal output may detail further sub-errors
or logs, usually pointing to an underlying issue in the
Gradle build configuration or dependencies.
 
 
Significance in Development
 

Encountering this error can significantly disrupt
the development workflow, as debugging is an
essential part of Flutter app development.
 
Timely resolution of such errors is crucial for
maintaining productivity and ensuring that app
features can be tested and verified in a timely
manner.
 
 
Example Context
 
Consider a scenario where a new dependency is
added to the `pubspec.yaml` file. If the dependency
version is incompatible with other parts of the
project, it might trigger this Gradle task failure during
the build process.
 
Similarly, incorrect updates or configurations in
the `android/build.gradle` file, such as incorrect SDK
versions or missing configurations, could also lead to
this build error.
 
 
Resolution Workflow
 
While the exact solution is context-dependent,
examining Gradle logs often provides clues. Running
the build command with verbose logging can offer
more insights.
 
For example, adjusting the verbosity of the Flutter
build environment can be achieved with the following
command:
 

flutter run -v
 
This command helps in gathering detailed logs,
which can aid in determining the precise cause of the
failure.
 
What Causes Exception:
Gradle task assembleDebug
failed with exit code 1 (again)
in Flutter
 
Common Causes for "Gradle task assembleDebug failed
with exit code 1" in Flutter
 
Dependencies Conflicts: A common cause can
be conflicts or compatibility issues between the
dependencies used within the `pubspec.yaml` file.

This can happen when specific library versions are
not compatible with one another.
 
Incorrect SDK Versions: Having mismatched SDK
versions between the Android build tools, Android
SDK, and Flutter SDK can cause this error. Ensure all
necessary SDK components are aligned for
compatibility.
 
Build Script Errors: Errors in the `build.gradle`
files, such as incorrect or missing configurations in
the `android/app/build.gradle` or
`android/build.gradle` files, can lead to failures
during the build process.
 
Code Errors: Syntax errors or issues in your Dart
code can sometimes manifest themselves during the
build process, causing Gradle task failures. Such
issues can include missing semicolons, incorrect
import statements, or improper code structure.
 
Manifest Issues: Inconsistencies or
misconfigurations in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file,
such as incorrect package names or missing
permissions, can result in build errors.
 
Resource Conflicts: When there are conflicting
resource files or naming conflicts within the
subdirectories of the `res` folder in the Android
project structure, Gradle might fail to assemble the
debug version.
 
Environmental Issues: Settings within your
development environment, such as incorrect Java
Home configurations or outdated Android Studio
installations, might interfere with the Gradle build
process.
 

Outdated Plugins: Using outdated or deprecated
Gradle plugins in your project could cause the build
process to fail. Regular updates and maintenance of
such plugins are essential for stable build processes.
 
 
android {
    compileSdkVersion 30
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.myapp"
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 30
        ...
    }
    ...
}
 
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

How to Fix Exception: Gradle
task assembleDebug failed
with exit code 1 (again) in
Flutter
 
Ensure Flutter and Dart Are Updated
 
Run the following commands to update Flutter and
Dart to their latest stable versions. Keeping the tools
updated can often resolve many build issues:

 
flutter upgrade
flutter pub upgrade
 
Clear Flutter and Gradle Caches
 
Clearing the cache can resolve conflicts or
corruption that may have been introduced over time.
This step ensures that all dependencies are fetched
fresh:
 
flutter clean
rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/
 
Update Gradle Wrapper
 
Ensure your project is using the latest Gradle
Wrapper. Navigate to the `android/` directory of your
Flutter project and run:
 
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version latest
 
Match SDK Versions
 
Ensure that your build.gradle file matches the
latest SDK version installed on your machine. Edit
your `android/app/build.gradle` file to set the right
compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion:
 
android {
  compileSdkVersion 33

  defaultConfig {
    targetSdkVersion 33
  }
}
 
Sync Gradle Files
 
Sometimes, syncing the Gradle files can solve the
issue. Open the `android` directory in Android Studio
and click on `Sync Project with Gradle Files`.
 
Add or Update Android SDK in Environment Path
 
If your Android SDK path is not properly set, it
might be causing the error. Make sure your
environment variables are set correctly. If necessary,
add the SDK path to your environment variables:
 
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
 
Investigate Dependencies
 
In some cases, conflicts or issues with specific
dependencies might be causing the problem. Open
your `pubspec.yaml`, review each plugin version, and
ensure that they are compatible with your current
Flutter version. Update them as needed:
 
dependencies:
  flutter:

    sdk: flutter
  ...
 
Run a Clean Build
 
If none of the above fixes worked, try creating a
completely new build. Sometimes projects can have
lingering issues due to older build artifacts. Run the
following command:
 
flutter build apk --debug
 
Additional Diagnostics
 
As a last resort, investigate the output of the
Gradle build for more insights and attempt a manual
build while ensuring network connectivity to resolve
any potential library download issues. Use the
following command to execute a more detailed build:
 
flutter run --verbose
