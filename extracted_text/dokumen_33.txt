Definition
Namespace: System
Assemblies: netstandard.dll, S ystem.Runtime.dll
Source: ArithmeticException.cs
The exception that is thrown for errors in an arithmetic, casting, or conversion operation.

Derived System. Divide ByZero Exception
System. NotFinite Number Exception
System. Overflow Exception
Remarks
ArithmeticException  is the base class for the following exceptions:
DivideByZeroException , which is thrown in integer division when the divisor is 0. For example,
attempting to divide 10 by 0 throws a DivideByZeroException  exception.
NotFiniteNumberException , which is thrown when an operation is performed on or returns
Double.NaN , Double.NegativeInfinity , Double.P ositiveInfinity , Single.NaN , Single.NegativeInfinity ,
Single.P ositiveInfinity , and the programming language used does not support those values.
OverflowException , which is thrown when the result of an operation is outside the bounds of the
target data type. That is, it is less than a number's MinValue property or greater than its MaxValue
property. For example, attempting to assign 200 + 200 to a Byte value throws an OverflowException
exception, since 400 greater than 256, the upper bound of the Byte data type.
Your code should not handle or throw this exception. Instead, you should either handle or throw one of
its derived classes, since it more precisely indicates the exact nature of the error.
For a list of initial property values for an instance of ArithmeticException , see the ArithmeticException
constructors.
ArithmeticException  uses the HRESUL T COR_E_ARITHMETIC, which has the value 0x80070216.
